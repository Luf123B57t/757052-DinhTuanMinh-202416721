Question: Java doesn’t allow you to create a constructor method to build a DVD
by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category, since this
action can create two constructors with the same signature (the same name, the
same parameter’s type: String), and this is not permitted in Java. Constructor
overloading is only valid when constructors have different signatures, meaning
they differ in at least one of the following: the number of parameters, data types
of parameters, the order of parameter types.
